      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>
        When this extension is activated, you'll be unable to access any content
        on the main page of YouTube. While you can search for specific videos in
        the search bar, you won't see any of the recommended videos on the main
        page.
      </p>
      <h3>How It Helps You</h3>
      <p>
        When you're trying to concentrate, it's easy to jump to YouTube and drop
        half an hour on the first few videos that pop up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Focus helps you spend more time working on what matters. By delivering a
        gentle reminder whenever you visit YouTube, Focus is a non-intrusive
        enhancement to your workflow.
