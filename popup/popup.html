      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>
        When this extension is activated, you'll be unable to access any content
        on the main pages of YouTube, Facebook, or Reddit.

      <h3>How It Helps You</h3>
      <p>
        When you're trying to concentrate, it's easy to jump to YouTube,
        Facebook, or Reddit and start mindlessly scrolling through the content
        these sites give you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Focus helps you spend more time working on what matters. By delivering a
        gentle reminder whenever you visit your favorite distracting site, Focus
        provides a non-intrusive and motivational enhancement to your workflow.
